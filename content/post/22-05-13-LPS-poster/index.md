The CoMet website (https://comet-toolkit.org) and github page (https://github.com/comet-toolkit) for the CoMet toolkit are now up and running.

After two years of development of the tools, we are very excited we can now make our tools available as open-source on github and the comet-toolkit webpage.
This is an important milestone for CoMet, and will allow the tools to be used by the wider scientific community.
